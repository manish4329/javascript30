      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.

      const team = players;
      //   console.log(team, players);

      // You might think we can just do something like this:

      // however what happens when we update that array?
      //   team[3] = "lux";

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way

      let team2 = players.slice();
      team2[3] = "lux";
      //   console.log(players, team2);
      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      let team3 = [].concat(players);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      let team4 = [...players];
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
      let team5 = Array.from(players);
      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
        social: {
          twitter: "@wesbos",
          faceBook: "@manpunk",
        },
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      //   const captain = person;
      //   captain.number = 99;
      // how do we take a copy instead?

      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 12});
      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      //   const cap3 = {...person};
      //   cap3.age = 15;
      //   cap3.social.twitter = "@coolman";

      const cap4 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
      cap4.social.twitter = "@coolman";

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
